ODB was often noted for his trademark microphone techniques and his 'outrageously profane, free-associative rhymes delivered in a distinctive half-rapped, half-sung style'.

The Miami New Times described Raekwon’s music as being street epics that are 'straightforward yet linguistically rich universes not unlike a gangsta Illiad.'"),
